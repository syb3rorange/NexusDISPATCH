# 🚨 Nexus Dispatch CAD - Deployment Guide

If your GitHub Pages site is blank, it's because GitHub does not know how to run TypeScript (`.tsx`) files automatically. 

### 🚀 Recommended (Free & Easy): Use Vercel
Vercel is the gold standard for hosting React apps for free. It will automatically build your site.

1.  Create a **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** account.
2.  Click **"Add New"** > **"Project"**.
3.  Import your GitHub repository.
4.  Vercel will detect the `package.json`, run the build command, and give you a live URL in 30 seconds.
5.  **Done!** Your site will work perfectly.

### 🛠️ Using GitHub Pages (Advanced)
If you *must* use GitHub Pages, you cannot just upload the files. You have to build them first:
1.  Run `npm install` and then `npm run build` on your computer.
2.  Upload the contents of the generated `dist` folder to GitHub.
3.  **Vercel is much easier—highly recommended!**

### 🤝 How to Sync with Friends
1.  Open your live URL.
2.  The browser adds a code like `#abc123xyz` to the end.
3.  **Copy that whole link** and give it to your friends. They will be in the same Dispatch room as you!
